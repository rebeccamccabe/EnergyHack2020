Team Thales - Charge Point Challenge - MIT Energy Hackathon

This is a matlab optimization I developed in 36 hours to find an optimal power profile for EV charging at the grid, site, and car level.
The algorithm works to minimize peaks in the grid while prioritizing charging during hours of clean grid energy.
The primary code for our model is in `charge_optimizer.m`.
